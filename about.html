                    <h3> Stumbling upon mathematics</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify"> Since my high school days, I have been interested in coding programs using languages such as C++ and Fortran. However, I could never quite see myself charting out a career path based solely on computer programing. Like most of my fellow students, I started attending additional classes to join the race in securing seats in reputed engineering colleges around the country. Unfortunatley, the extra study hours did not serve their purpose, but they did end up strengthening my Mathematics, a subject I had an affinity towards from the very beggining. So, while most of my peers were getting into engineering colleges after school, I decided to choose Mathematics for my undergraduate studies. It was a big risk I was taking based primarily on my school-life impression of mathematics, which does not even come close to describing college level mathematics. Fortunately for me, the gamble paid off. </p>

                    <h3> Life at Delhi University</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">I fell in love with Delhi University from the moment I set foot on campus. It was vibrant,colourful and bustling with spirited students. So I enrolled myself for B.Sc. (Hons.) Mathematics at Hindu College in north campus. College life was the whole package, filled with society events, never-ending hangout sessions, trips with friends, college fests, with some romance and heartbreaks sprinkled on the top. At the same time, I was fortunate enough to have professors who gave me the flavor of what mathematics is all about, encouraging me to pursue it further. While I admit I may not have learnt a great deal of high level mathematics, but college did form a launchpad for my research career in the years to follow. In all, the three years at Delhi University form the most memorable and unforgetable years of my life.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify"> After clearing a written examination and a personal interview, I joined the integrated Ph.D. program at TIFR Centre for Applicable Mathmatics in 2010. It was a whole new level of mathematics for me. The first two years which comprise the Masters program where very challenging. However, being in TIFR you are at an advantage. Firstly, it is one of the most reputed research institutes in the country with strong connections with leading rearchers around the globe, who frequently visit the institute giving the students the chance to interact with them and gain from their experience. Secondly, the faculty at TIFR-CAM is very student friendly with their doors always open to students for guidance. Thirdly, the institute has a relatively small community of students, thus everyone knows everyone else very well. And finally, the institute really takes care of its students in terms of good accomodation and facilities, allowing the students to focus on their coursework without worries. But make no doubts -- to survive here and strive for excellence, you need a lot of commitment and hardwork.  </p>

                    <h3> Stepping into the research arena</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify"> With my M.Sc. nearing its end, I had to make a crucial decision -- get a job in the industry or continue with mathematics and research. The first option had been more or less ruled out based on the fact that my current qualifications would not allow me to secure a job position which would do justice to what I had achieved thus far. This brought me to another crossroad -- should I continue in TIFR or apply to the US. The downside of applying to the US were twofold. Firstly, I would have to repeat my Masters, following which I could start my Ph.D. "provided I cleared the qualifiers", which could go on for almost 5 more years. Honestly speaking this was not a big hurdle, provided I liked the research work I would be engaged in. But the second and perhaps the more crucial issue was whether I was built for research. I had technically not done any form of research work during the first to years at TIFR, so I could not answer this question. I decided the best way to figure out would be to continue my third year at TIFR, also known as the M.Phil. year, to get my hands dirty with some form of research work, in an area I hoped I would like. So I decided to work on numerical methods for fluid flows with Dr. Praveen Chandrashekar. Why did I pick this field? Well, it allowed me to combine two areas I enjoyed the most -- mathematics and programming. By the end of year three, I had gained a great deal of theoretical and technical expertise in the area of computational fluid dynamics, found my research area, and successfully defended my M.Phil. thesis, thus qualifying into the Ph.D. program at TIFR. A lot of credit goes to the invaluable guidance and support of my supervisor, who demanded both quantity and quality from my work.   </p>
